# crab-tracker
Crab Tracker, named after the Crab Nebula, is an affordable altazimuth tracker for astrophotography.
Inspired by the OpenAstroTracker, this is an exploration of the possibility of an altazimuth style mount,
rather than an equatorial mount like the OAT. It should require less printed parts than the OAT,
and will not need a large RA ring. <br> <br>
